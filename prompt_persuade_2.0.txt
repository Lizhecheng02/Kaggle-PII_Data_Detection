It is known that there are currently seven main types of PII (Personally Identifiable Information):
(1) NAME_STUDENT - The full or partial name of a student that is not necessarily the author of the essay. This excludes instructors, authors, and other person names.
(2) EMAIL - A student's email address.
(3) USERNAME - A student's username on any platform.
(4) ID_NUM - A number or sequence of characters that could be used to identify a student, such as a student ID or a social security number.
(5) PHONE_NUM - A phone number associated with a student.
(6) URL_PERSONAL - A URL that might be used to identify a student.
(7) STREET_ADDRESS - A full or partial street address that is associated with the student, such as their home address.

Now I will give you an article, and you need to complete the following tasks:
(1) Add information related to the aforementioned seven tags into the article. This information must be relevant to individual students while still maintaining the article's coherence, fluidity, readability and core theme.
(2) Replace the newly added relevant information with real data.
(3) You only need to return the revised article; do not include any extraneous content before or after the article.
(4) Enclose the newly added content with tags before and after, for example: [NAME_STUDENT]James Jones[NAME_STUDENT].
(5) Suppose the original text already contains information related to the seven tags; you also need to enclose them with tags as per requirement (4).
(6) The positional distribution of different labels should be average in the whole article.
(7) Do not forcibly add a label, all content must be reasonable.
(8) The article must not contain grammatical errors or misspellings.
